Add config to turn TEMP data collection off

simple logging via DEBUG config - make log retention configurable

Consider rsync for sending the data and storing all data in a local 
graphite/influxdb instance

create logdel alias - and sms command to do it remotely.

Figure out server data delay

Create email notification of data stopping, with another notification of it
restarting, and when restarting send X bytes based on data stopped window

Fix bug in smsParse that throws exception if there is no message to read

Fix bug in simServer that doesn't show last response until next request
